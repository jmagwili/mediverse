# Mediverse

Welcome to Mediverse! This README provides instructions on how to set up and run the project locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- Angular CLI installed globally (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jmagwili/mediverse.git

2. In your terminal, navigate to your project directory
3. Install NPM dependencies
    ```sh
   npm install

## Running the App

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
